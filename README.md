## Project Objectives

The primary objective of the London Crime Heatmap project is to empower both current and prospective residents of London with information that can help them make informed decisions about their safety. While the project currently covers a subset of available crime data due to technological constraints, it offers a valuable glimpse into the varying levels of criminal activity across different areas of London.

## Current Status

**Please note**: The "wards" section of the website is currently under development and is not operational at this time. We are actively working to bring this feature online to provide you with a more comprehensive analysis of crime statistics in different wards of London.

For the best user experience, we recommend accessing the platform via a laptop or desktop computer.

## Feedback Mechanisms

Your feedback is invaluable in enhancing and expanding this project. We invite you to share your thoughts, suggestions, and any issues you encounter via email at [Abdullah.alotaishan@kcl.ac.uk](mailto:Abdullah.alotaishan@kcl.ac.uk).
